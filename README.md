Our plan is to get data from kaaggle. We will be using the countries of the world and world happiness report datasets

Sources of data
We want to gather the following information for each country that we have in our dataset:
Countries of the world:  Infant mortality (per 1000 births), GDP ($ per capita) , literacy(%),  population density,  continent
World Happiness: all the metrics of happiness columns that add to the happiness score

Type of transformation:
joining country, filtering continent

Type of Database:
We will use postgreSQL as our database.

Final Table:
The original tables: countries of the world and world happiness report + our newly created table for analysis
